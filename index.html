        <p>
          Welcome to Cappuccino, where every cup is brewed with passion and
          care. Nestled in the heart of Roma, we are more than just a coffee
          shop—we're a community hub where friends meet, ideas flow, and every
          sip brings comfort. At Cappuccino, we believe in the art of coffee.
          Our beans are carefully sourced from sustainable farms around the
          world, ensuring that every blend is as unique as the story behind it.
          Whether you're here for a quick espresso, a leisurely latte, or a new
          seasonal specialty, we take pride in crafting each drink to
          perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
